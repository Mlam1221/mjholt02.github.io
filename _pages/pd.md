#### Statistics and Domain Knowledge
My primary focus is on utilizing available resources to continue to build upon my formal education in Statistics with the most current methods and techniques 
for estimation and prediction used in industry today.  I also plan to build upon my formal statistical training by increasing my knowledge of the Bayesian framework.


#### Coding and Computer Science
My primary focus is on maintaining high levels of proficiency in R and SQL. I will utilize Python occasionally to remain competent enough to 
understand referenced code and perform most data manipulation and modelling with a moderate amount of references to examples and training materials. 
To continue a more formal approach into computer science I plan to utilize C# to reinforce programming techniques that Iâ€™ve missed coming from the statistical 
side of things.
